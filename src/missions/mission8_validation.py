# =============================================================================
# Mission 8: Light Bending Validation (Analytic vs Numeric)
# =============================================================================
# Purpose:
#   - Validates the numeric integration of light bending against the weak-field analytic formula.
#   - Demonstrates how to measure and compare deflection angles for rays near a black hole.
# Guidance for Participants:
#   - Use the analytic formula Δφ ≈ 2 r_s / b for large impact parameters (b).
#   - Measure the numeric deflection by comparing initial and outgoing ray angles.
#   - Tune measure thresholds and integration step sizes for different regimes.
#   - Review the ValidatingRay class and measurement logic for validation details.
# Implementation Notes:
#   - Rays are considered measurable once far from the black hole (x > measure_x_m, r > measure_r_m).
#   - Outgoing direction is approximated from the last two trail points; more precision can be achieved by fitting a line to far-field points.
#   - Printing comparisons helps validate integrator accuracy and weak-field agreement.
