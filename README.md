# Black Hole Simulator 2D Hackathon Skeleton

This repository is the skeleton branch for the Black Hole Simulator 2D hackathon. Clone this branch to start your own solution branch and implement the missions!

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thekasperdev/black-hole-simulator-2d-python
   cd black-hole-simulator-2d-python
   ```

2. **Check out the skeleton branch and create your own branch:**
   ```
   git checkout start-with-a-clone-of-this-branch
   git checkout -b my-solution-branch
   ```
   Replace `my-solution-branch` with your chosen branch name. This ensures you work on your own branch based on the skeleton.

3. **Create a Python virtual environment:**
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   This keeps your dependencies isolated for the hackathon project.

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Explore the missions:**
   - All missions are in `src/missions/`.
   - Each mission file is a skeleton with method stubs and essential shader setup.
   - Read the comments in each file to understand what you need to implement.

6. **Start coding:**
   - Implement your own logic in each mission file.
   - Use the provided vertex shader code to focus on simulation and visualization.
   - Add your own classes, functions, and tests as needed.

## Hackathon Workflow

- Work in your own solution branch cloned from this skeleton.
- Each mission builds on the previous one. Complete them in order for best results.
- Run `mission_control.py` to test your implementation. In case of doubt ask one of the briliant "scientists" or run the solution branch.
- Ask questions and collaborate with other participants!

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- moderngl
- numpy

## Support
If you have questions, reach out to the hackathon organizers or check the comments in each mission file for guidance.

Good luck and have fun!
